Uddāna 2. Background for the establishment of the Pravāraṇākarma. A group of monks once, during
the rainy season, kept a vow of silence. As one of them related this to the Buddha, he
said that this was a practice of the Tīrthikas, and he banned it. Then the Buddha established
the pravāraṇā, and made rules for the ceremony. Panglung p. 13.
